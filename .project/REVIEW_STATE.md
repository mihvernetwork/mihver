# Review State

Durable review/approval state, updated at the end of each task per `REVIEW_PROTOCOL.md`'s
completion checklist. Never invent or assume approval: if a human has not explicitly stated it,
record the gate as pending, not granted. A Codex or Claude `APPROVED` verdict is a technical
assessment, not human sign-off — see `AGENT_POLICY.md`'s Authority Hierarchy.

**Branch/task-scoped, like [CURRENT_TASK.md](./CURRENT_TASK.md).** The "Latest Review" section
below describes the current gate only when *both* hold: `CURRENT_TASK.md` is active for the
checked-out branch, and this file's own declared Branch/Task (below) matches that same
branch/task. `npm run context` checks this automatically. When either condition fails — no active
task, or this file's Branch/Task doesn't match the active one — the "Latest Review" content is
historical/stale task metadata only, not the current gate; `PROJECT_STATE.md`'s "Next Authorized
Action" is authoritative for what's next, not anything below.

## Latest Review

Task: M0-ADR-0004-FINAL-TAXONOMY-CLOSURE
Branch: `m0/adr-0004-memory-context-authority`
PR: `mihvernetwork/mihver#15` (updated in place — not a new PR)

A narrow final semantic closure, before any foundation-amendment work begins. Closed three remaining
gaps: (1) made the Historical User Provenance Gate (M-18) explicitly type-independent — the gate
applies to any admitted record production's content inspection reveals as a historical user
statement, regardless of stored Brain `type`, with a new requirement that a citation must be
inspectable *and resolvable*, not merely citation-shaped; new Case 23 (misfiled `reference`-type
record); (2) introduced `DECISION_OPTION` as a fourth Influence Taxonomy tier, reconciling
memory-informed R-19 defaults without weakening `DISCOVERY_ATTENTION`'s additive-only invariant — new
Invariant M-21, new Case 24 (genuinely R-19-eligible default vs. an intent-level value R-19
excludes); (3) explicitly decided ADR-0004's Acceptance Gate — a new subsection naming four
dependencies (A: core `M0_SCOPE.md`; B: `INTENT_SPEC.md` Inference-premise; C: `REQUIREMENT_SPEC.md`
Requirement-Level-Inference; D: `REQUIREMENT_SPEC.md` R-19 provenance) and deciding Accepted-eligible
status requires dependency A alone, with dependencies B/C/D remaining explicitly, structurally
disabled until their own separate amendments. Full detail recorded in `ADR-0004`, `MEMORY_CONTEXT.md`,
and `MEMORY_CONTEXT_CASES.md` (now 24 cases) themselves, not duplicated here. This entry records the
review round that checked those three fixes.

### Review round — three independent read-only Codex reviewers, dispatched by interaction axis

A (Brain Type × Historical Provenance), B (Influence Taxonomy × R-19), C (Amendment Sequencing ×
Cross-Document Consistency). All three found real, independently-verified defects; Claude
independently re-verified every finding against the actual current text before acting — not accepted
by reviewer majority vote.

**Reviewer A (Brain Type × Historical Provenance):**
- The Semantic Authority Classes table's individual rows still used absolute, type-determined
  language that contradicted the new type-independence rule: `lesson`'s note said misfiled
  user-facing content "is misfiled and excluded, not reclassified into a semantic use" (directly
  denying the gate applies); `playbook` said `PROCESS_ONLY` "always"; `reference` said
  `DISCOVERY_ATTENTION` "permanently" and required clearing the Evidence gate "before any semantic
  use" — all false for a record Case 23 itself shows can be Category A. Fixed with an explicit
  override note after the table (in both `MEMORY_CONTEXT.md` and `ADR-0004`'s duplicate) stating every
  row's classification is conditioned on content actually matching that row's typical class, and only
  `inbox` is a genuine, unconditional, type-determined exclusion.
- `inbox` ordering, Category A resolvability language, and the ADR's mis-storage-risk mitigation
  claim were all confirmed clean — no defect.

**Reviewer B (Influence Taxonomy × R-19):**
- The `DECISION_OPTION` definition's claim that it has "no further independent downstream gate"
  (unlike `DISCOVERY_ATTENTION`) overstated the distinction: `DISCOVERY_ATTENTION` already can and
  does directly alter intermediate `ResearchPlan`/`TechnologyCandidateSet`/`ArchitectureCandidate`
  content — Case 20 shows this concretely. The real distinction is what each tier can **establish**:
  `DISCOVERY_ATTENTION`'s candidates always still need an independent mechanism (Evidence-gate
  clearance, eligibility screening, Evaluation) to settle anything; `DECISION_OPTION`'s adoption *is*
  the immediate establishment of Requirement content, under the stage's own pre-existing authority,
  with no further mechanism left to clear. Fixed in both `MEMORY_CONTEXT.md` and `ADR-0004`.
- Stale three-tier inventories survived in `ADR-0004`'s Phase 4 axis 7 and its Consequences section
  (both still listed only `PROCESS_ONLY`/`DISCOVERY_ATTENTION`/`SEMANTIC_PREMISE`). Fixed to four
  tiers; also corrected the Consequences section's "Status stays Proposed until [every stage
  amended]" to match the Acceptance Gate's actual dependency-A-only condition.
- Case 24's chain (`MemoryContext` → `DECISION_OPTION` → Requirement Derivation's own R-19 judgment →
  R-09 marking → memory-informed-rationale provenance), the "3 retries" example's genuine R-19
  eligibility, the "should retry happen at all" contrast's genuine R-19 exclusion, the
  non-obligating/zero-authority safeguards, and `DISCOVERY_ATTENTION`'s own untouched additive-only
  invariant were all confirmed clean — no defect.

**Reviewer C (Amendment Sequencing × Cross-Document Consistency):**
- The Historical User Memory Rule's clarification-question path claimed "This path requires no
  amendment" — literally false, since it still requires dependency A (Intent Parsing's own
  `M0_SCOPE.md` authorization); only dependency B is what it skips. Fixed to say "requires no
  additional `INTENT_SPEC.md` amendment (dependency B)" and note dependency A still applies.
- Cases 16 and 19 said "pending its own required amendment" / omitted which dependency gated their
  premise-citation path; Case 24 didn't mention dependency D (the R-19 provenance amendment) at all,
  and the corpus preamble's amendment-qualification paragraph only named dependencies B/C, not D.
  Fixed all four to name the specific dependency (B or D) each capability needs, and extended the
  preamble to cover D.
- The Acceptance Gate's own precedent citation said "the same condition `ADR-0002` and `ADR-0003`
  were each held to" — factually inaccurate for `ADR-0003`, whose Status (verified directly) is still
  `Proposed`, not `Accepted`; it has proposed a similar future condition for itself, not satisfied
  one. Fixed to cite `ADR-0002` (Accepted) as the actual satisfied precedent and `ADR-0003` as a
  parallel proposed criterion, not a completed example. Also softened an overclaim that requiring all
  four dependencies "contradicts" Principle 12 (Evolvability) to "works against Principle 12's
  underlying objective," since Principle 12 doesn't literally prescribe ADR acceptance governance.
- Full-ADR Acceptance-sequencing consistency (Status/Context/Consequences/Risks/Open Questions/Future
  Work all agreeing on the A-only gate) and Phase 11 vs. Acceptance Gate's own internal consistency
  were both confirmed clean — no defect.

`npm test`: 32/32 throughout (unaffected — no contract/schema/runtime file touched). `git diff main
--stat`: the same three docs plus these two `.project` files; no foundation document modified.
`git diff --check`: clean.

**Final recommendation: unchanged, `FOUNDATION_AMENDMENT_REQUIRED`** — every confirmed finding this
round was a scoping, internal-consistency, or omission defect within the already-selected Model C,
never evidence the model itself is unsound (so not `REDESIGN_REQUIRED`). No new semantic blocker
remains after this round's fixes, and the document set is now internally consistent across four
review rounds: **`READY_FOR_MERGE_AS_PROPOSED_ADR`** — ready for human review and merge in its
honest, Proposed state, with dependencies B/C/D correctly recorded as future, separately-gated work,
not blockers to merging this ADR itself.

## Required Changes

None remaining — every confirmed finding across all four review rounds (the original Phase 12 four
reviewers; the cross-boundary-remediation round's four reviewers; the authority-provenance-closure
round's four reviewers; this round's three reviewers) was fixed and re-verified against the edited
text (`npm test`: 32/32 throughout, across all four rounds).

## Fixes Applied

See "Latest Review" above for this round's full list; see "History"'s `M0-ADR-0004-AUTHORITY-
PROVENANCE-CLOSURE`, `M0-ADR-0004-CROSS-BOUNDARY-REMEDIATION`, and `M0-ADR-0004-MEMORY-CONTEXT-
AUTHORITY` entries for the three prior rounds' lists. Applied to
`docs/adr/ADR-0004-MEMORY-CONTEXT-AUTHORITY-BOUNDARY.md`, `docs/contracts/MEMORY_CONTEXT.md`, and
`docs/examples/MEMORY_CONTEXT_CASES.md` — no frozen foundation document touched, across any round.

## Pending Human Gate

PR `mihvernetwork/mihver#15` (title `M0: define memory context authority boundary`, from the
`devSerdar` fork) already exists and was updated in place by this round — not a new PR, per this
task's explicit instruction. Not merged by this task, despite this round's `READY_FOR_MERGE_AS_
PROPOSED_ADR` verdict — merge remains a human decision, never taken unilaterally. `ADR-0004` remains
Proposed — the `M0_SCOPE.md`/`INTENT_SPEC.md`/`REQUIREMENT_SPEC.md` amendments this design identifies
as required (dependencies A/B/C/D, per the ADR's own "Acceptance Gate") are each their own separate,
future, explicitly human-authorized task; none is a precondition for merging this ADR itself in its
honest, Proposed state. Human review of PR #15 is the next gate.

## History

- 2026-08-22 — `M0-ADR-0004-AUTHORITY-PROVENANCE-CLOSURE` (PR #15, third round): closed six further
  gaps a follow-up task specified: a Historical User Provenance Gate (Category A direct/Category B
  derived-unverified historical user statements, new M-18) gating which entries may ever be cited as
  an Inferred Claim's premise; a Classification Fail-Closed Rule (new M-19) requiring production to
  record classification basis/method/ambiguity and resolve ambiguity toward less authority; removal
  of residual wording letting production treat "an artifact was supplied" as equivalent to "a
  contradiction judgment was supplied"; an explicit Identity Boundary (memory never becomes Evidence,
  regardless of re-verification — only a wholly new artifact does); an R-19 memory-informed-default
  Foundation Impact item; and a Historical Force Is Not Current Force rule (new M-20, new Case 22)
  plus an M-07 correction restoring I-16's "not by itself" qualifier an earlier round had silently
  over-strengthened. Four independent Codex reviewers by interaction axis (A: Historical Provenance ×
  Normative Force; B: Producer Classification × Least Authority; C: Memory × Evidence × Requirement
  Defaults; D: cross-document/corpus contradiction) found real defects: Case 19 bypassed M-18 entirely
  (no Category A/B designation on cited premises); Case 22's worked force example was internally
  self-contradictory; `ADR-0004`'s own duplicated content lagged `MEMORY_CONTEXT.md`'s fixes yet again
  (Phase 4 freshness judgment, Phase 7/8 stale "memory reaches `SEMANTIC_PREMISE`" wording); a second
  unfixed artifact-vs-verdict conflation survived in the Producer's "Not allowed to decide" bullet;
  Reproducibility/M-14 snapshot inventories weren't updated for the new classification-metadata facts;
  Case 8 and M-03 both carried stale/incomplete gating language; Cases 3/12 missed the corpus
  preamble's promised immateriality notes. All fixed and independently re-verified. `npm test`: 32/32.
  Verdict: `FOUNDATION_AMENDMENT_REQUIRED` (unchanged). Moved here from "Latest Review" now that those
  sections describe `M0-ADR-0004-FINAL-TAXONOMY-CLOSURE` instead, per this file's branch/task scoping
  (all entries for this branch share PR #15, since each was a continuation, not a new branch). —
  branch `m0/adr-0004-memory-context-authority`

- 2026-08-21 — `M0-ADR-0004-CROSS-BOUNDARY-REMEDIATION` (PR #15, second round): an external human
  review of the first draft accepted Model C but found six cross-boundary issues (circular scope
  anchor, undefined producer authority, admissibility-vs-interpretation conflation, a false
  procedural/semantic binary, undefined lifecycle/invalidation, ambiguous cross-project corpus
  language) requiring resolution before foundation-amendment work begins. Fixed by introducing
  `RunContext` (non-memory run-identity anchor), a full "MemoryContext Producer: Role and Authority"
  contract, an admissibility-vs-interpretation split, a three-tier Influence Taxonomy
  (`PROCESS_ONLY`/`DISCOVERY_ATTENTION`/`SEMANTIC_PREMISE`), a full Lifecycle/Invalidation model, and
  deterministic per-case scope statements (corpus grew from 20 to 21 cases, adding Case 21 for
  `RunContext`'s explicit absence). Four independent Codex reviewers by interaction axis (A: Scope
  Anchor × Producer Authority; B: Lifecycle × Reproducibility; C: Process × Discovery × Semantic
  Authority; D: cross-document/corpus contradiction) found real defects, mostly the remediation's own
  fixes not propagated to `ADR-0004`'s duplicate copies (a stale `project`-anchor table row, stale
  "produced by one stage" language, stale procedural/semantic terminology in Phase 6/7/8/9) plus a
  self-contradiction between the Producer's "mechanical only" scope authority and pre-existing
  "genuinely project-agnostic" content-judgment text (resolved by deferring that judgment to the
  consuming stage), a functional-exclusion loophole in Case 8, a cross-run reuse gap, and a Case 18
  cardinality conflict. All fixed and independently re-verified. `npm test`: 32/32. Verdict:
  `FOUNDATION_AMENDMENT_REQUIRED` (unchanged). Moved here from "Latest Review" now that those sections
  describe `M0-ADR-0004-AUTHORITY-PROVENANCE-CLOSURE` instead, per this file's branch/task scoping
  (both entries share branch `m0/adr-0004-memory-context-authority` and PR #15). — branch
  `m0/adr-0004-memory-context-authority`

- 2026-08-21 — `M0-ADR-0004-MEMORY-CONTEXT-AUTHORITY` (PR #15, first draft/review round): semantic/
  architectural design task integrating MIHVER Brain / durable memory into Mihver Architect without
  violating `ADR-0001`/`ADR-0002`/`ADR-0003`. Phases 0–11 (memory retrieval, authority map, threat
  model, integration-model comparison — Model C selected over A/B/D, authority model, historical-
  user-memory rule, current-input precedence, procedural/semantic split, evidence boundary,
  reproducibility model, 20-case corpus, foundation impact) produced `ADR-0004`, `MEMORY_CONTEXT.md`,
  `MEMORY_CONTEXT_CASES.md`. Four independent read-only Codex reviewers by interaction axis (A: memory
  × epistemic provenance; B: memory × stage isolation; C: memory × evidence/architecture; D:
  cross-axis adversarial) found real, independently-verified defects, all fixed after Claude
  independently re-verified each: most significantly, an under-classified `INTENT_SPEC.md`/
  `REQUIREMENT_SPEC.md` dependency (citing a `MemoryContext` entry as an Inference's premise
  genuinely broadens both documents' frozen premise/provenance models, requiring
  `SEMANTIC_AMENDMENT_REQUIRED`, not `CLARIFICATION_ONLY`); an Inferred/Assumed blurring risk closed
  with a "No Assumed-Origin Path for Memory" section; a cross-project loophole in Case 3; Phase 11's
  under-counted stage list (missing Architecture Synthesis); a reproducibility gap (bare hash/pointer
  insufficient, actual content copy required); Principle 5's five properties understated as four;
  a "procedural" search-influence risk that could functionally exclude candidates without formally
  excluding any; a frozen-snapshot/post-hoc-fact conflict resolved by splitting Reproducibility into
  production-time vs. consuming-artifact-provenance facts; an R-19 misuse in Case 16; a terminology
  slip in Case 14; an Architecture-Synthesis/EvidenceBundle factual error in Case 20; an
  inference-from-absence defect in Case 17. `npm test`: 32/32. Verdict: `FOUNDATION_AMENDMENT_REQUIRED`
  (not `REDESIGN_REQUIRED` — no reviewer found Model C unsound; not `READY_FOR_HUMAN_REVIEW` — the
  `INTENT_SPEC.md`/`REQUIREMENT_SPEC.md` amendment dependency is real and unmet). Moved here from
  "Latest Review" now that those sections describe `M0-ADR-0004-CROSS-BOUNDARY-REMEDIATION` instead,
  per this file's branch/task scoping (both entries share branch
  `m0/adr-0004-memory-context-authority` and PR #15, since this was a continuation, not a new
  branch). — branch `m0/adr-0004-memory-context-authority`

- 2026-08-21 — `PROJECT-STATE-RECONCILE-POST-STEP-03A` (PR #14): reconciled `.project/PROJECT_STATE.md`
  and `.project/DECISIONS_LOG.md` with actual `main` after M0 Step 03A (PR #13, `fe79098`) merged.
  Verified against live git/`gh` state, not stale `.project` prose: `ADR-0002`'s recorded status
  ("Proposed") was stale (it is Accepted); three merged checkpoints (Night Runner PR #7/#8, `ADR-0002`
  Acceptance PR #10/#11/#12, M0 Step 03A PR #13) were missing from "Frozen Steps / Checkpoints";
  `DECISIONS_LOG.md` had four "approved, not yet merged" entries (PR #4/#5/#6/#7) that are actually
  merged, plus two merges (PR #8, PR #13) with no entry at all — all fixed by appending verified-only
  facts, zero existing entries edited or removed. Drift analysis: both files are interpretive
  summaries of live truth, never authoritative themselves; the actual gap was that no task was ever
  scoped to reconcile state immediately after each of those merges (process), and no automated check
  cross-references `PROJECT_STATE.md`/`DECISIONS_LOG.md` claims against ADR `## Status` fields or
  `gh pr list --state merged` (validation) — proposed future invariant: extend
  `scripts/dev/project-context.mjs`'s existing drift-detection pattern to check both. One independent
  Codex reviewer (state authority / historical integrity) found two issues, both fixed: a premature
  cross-reference in `CURRENT_TASK.md`, and a `DECISIONS_LOG.md` entry asserting a claim not
  verifiable from git/GitHub the way its own preamble promised. `npm test`: 32/32. Verdict:
  `READY_FOR_HUMAN_REVIEW`. Moved here from "Latest Review" now that those sections describe
  `M0-ADR-0004-MEMORY-CONTEXT-AUTHORITY` instead, per this file's branch/task scoping. — branch
  `chore/project-state-reconcile-post-step-03a`

- 2026-08-21 — `M0-STEP-03A-FINAL-CROSS-REFERENCE-CLEANUP` (PR #13, sixth pass, no reviewers per its
  own instructions): a final independent verification found Case 7b's Eligibility citing "Case 2's
  Completeness" when Case 2 is explicitly Partial (from the fifth round) — replaced with Case 8, a
  genuinely equivalent Complete example. A deterministic sweep of every "Case X's
  Complete/Completeness/Partial" reference in `REQUIREMENT_CASES.md` then found two more instances of
  the same staleness under broader phrasing (Case 16 → Case 1, Case 15 → Case 1/9, both citing a
  pre-fix "testable now" framing the fifth round had already corrected) — fixed. Every remaining
  cross-reference checked against its target case's own current Eligibility and found accurate.
  `npm test`: 32/32. Verdict: CLEAN. PR #13 was subsequently merged to `main` (squash commit `fe79098`)
  — that merge event is recorded in `.project/DECISIONS_LOG.md`, not here. Moved here from "Latest
  Review" now that those sections describe `PROJECT-STATE-RECONCILE-POST-STEP-03A` instead, per this
  file's branch/task scoping — this is the first entry on a new branch, since the prior five rounds all
  shared `m0/step-03a-requirement-contract`. — branch `m0/step-03a-requirement-contract`

- 2026-08-21 — `M0-STEP-03A-FINAL-INTRINSIC-CONSISTENCY-FIX` (PR #13, fourth review round): fixed
  three issues an external final review found in head prior to `3866304`: (1) "What Qualifies as a
  Requirement" contradicted R-20 by implying unresolved-force binding content could already become a
  Requirement — rewritten to an explicit three-way split; (2) R-21 defined Complete/Partial via
  future-candidate-population phrases ("overwhelming majority of candidates") instead of the artifact's
  own semantics — rebuilt around a SATISFIED/NOT_SATISFIED/INDETERMINATE model, Case 4 re-derived
  rather than preserved by default; (3) "User-Selected Technology" let resolving a named technology's
  negotiability drift into revising its strength — fixed to keep force/strength and
  negotiability/exclusivity independent. Three reviewers (A: eligibility × force/R-20; B: completeness
  intrinsicness × Case 4/R-21; C: force × negotiability × cross-document consistency) then found
  further residual instances of the same three bugs in Claude's own same-task fixes: a second R-20
  contradiction in the Information-Loss Rules bullet (A); R-21 was gameable — nothing required the
  procedure to be faithful, so a trivial "always INDETERMINATE" procedure technically satisfied it,
  closed with a faithfulness/maximal-determinacy requirement (B); a strict-vs-inclusive threshold bug
  in Case 4's worked procedure, "under $100" needs `<` not `≤` (B); four more stale population phrases
  in Cases 7b/8/11 (B); three more force/negotiability conflations in R-19's terminology note, inside
  "User-Selected Technology" itself, ADR-0003's Decision item 3, and Case 15 (C). `npm test`: 32/32.

- 2026-08-21 — `M0-STEP-03A-BRAIN-ASSISTED-FINAL-AUDIT` (PR #13, third review round): before this
  round, queried MIHVER Brain (`../mihver-brain`) for review-planning lessons and applied two
  `mihver`-scope memories (decompose review by invariant axis; cross-axis interactions need explicit
  review contracts) — concretely, added a six-named-axis coverage checklist and applied
  pairwise-interaction scrutiny to Claude's own re-derivation, not only to reviewer briefs. Four
  independent read-only Codex reviewers by invariant interaction (A: normative × epistemic; B:
  resolution authority × lifecycle; C: testability × completeness, auditing all 17 cases; D:
  cross-document contradiction matrix). Confirmed and fixed: Requirement-Level Inference had no
  strength/provisionality rule analogous to R-03/R-04 — closed with new R-22; Case 8 was an unfilled
  placeholder that couldn't ground its own Complete/strength claims — rewritten concretely; Case 7a and
  Case 11's positive clause had zero metric/comparator, the same defect class Case 16's "fast" fix
  addressed but two more instances survived — both reclassified Partial for that clause; R-21 had a
  genuine wording tension between its no-invented-scope test and its boundary-refinement carve-out —
  sharpened into a two-situation test (later found in the very next round to still be gameable, and
  further tightened there — see "Latest Review" above); five smaller cross-document clarity fixes
  (stray "ambiguity" wording, ADR force-map summary, Partial-revision-path over-narrowing, "usable now"
  phrasing, an ADR Open Question). One reviewer disagreement (Case 4's cost-category Unknown
  fillability, now argued by three reviewers across two rounds) resolved a second time by
  re-derivation, not majority vote — kept Complete/fillable; the sharpened rule that resolved it also
  caught the Case 7a/11 defects, evidence it was correctly drawn. `npm test`: 32/32. Moved here from

- 2026-08-21 — `M0-STEP-03A-CROSS-AXIS-REMEDIATION` (PR #13, second review round): four independent
  read-only Codex reviewers by invariant axis (A: normative vs. epistemic; B: resolution authority; C:
  completeness/testability; D: cross-document contradiction). Confirmed and fixed: a residual
  strength-weakening sentence left over from the axis-independence fix (found independently by A, D);
  the Case 7b force/result mismatch (A, D); an ADR-0003 overclaim that confidence is mandatory on every
  Requirement (A, D); an overbroad R-20 scope contradicting Cases 6/17 (D); a Case 17 Failed-definition
  contradiction with R-17 (C, D); Case 16's Unknown reclassified to Ambiguity (B); a miscited R-01 in
  an Anti-Example (D); R-19 tightened with a terminology note reconciling it against
  `INTENT_SPEC.md`'s broader phrase (B); R-21 tightened to an oracle-based test (C); R-09 subordinated
  to R-19. One reviewer disagreement (Case 4's cost-category Unknown fillability, argued by Reviewer B)
  resolved by Claude's independent re-derivation, not majority vote — kept Complete/fillable, text
  strengthened to engage the counterexample directly. A final read-through caught one more
  cross-reference bug no reviewer flagged. `npm test`: 32/32. Moved here from "Latest Review" now that

- 2026-08-21 — `M0-STEP-03A-REQUIREMENT-SPEC-SEMANTIC-CONTRACT` (PR #13, first draft pass): three
  independent read-only Codex reviewers (A: provenance/epistemic boundary; B: requirement
  semantics — force mapping, conditions, leakage; C: lifecycle/handoff — eligibility,
  Complete/Partial/Failed, versioning), each reviewing the first draft of `REQUIREMENT_SPEC.md`,
  `ADR-0003-REQUIREMENT-DERIVATION-MODEL.md`, and `REQUIREMENT_CASES.md` (17 cases) against the
  already-Accepted `INTENT_SPEC.md`/`ADR-0002` model. All three found real, independently-verified
  defects; several were found by two or three reviewers independently. Confirmed and fixed:
  force-inflation bugs in three cases (Case 10/11/15, preference silently mapped to SHALL/MUST);
  a condition-strengthening bug ("only if" compiled to "if and only if") in both the main contract
  and Case 9; a self-contradiction in the Complete/Partial/Failed model (Failed's example identical
  to Complete-with-zero-Requirements'); an overclaim about downstream Partial-consumption
  authorization contradicting the ADR's own Open Questions; an interpretive-leap bug in Case 12 and
  an invalid Decision-Impact-level bug in Case 13 (both replaced with cleaner scenarios); plus
  smaller fixes (a dangling cross-reference, a missing provenance section, ambiguous invalidation
  wording, an unbounded inference-boundary concept given an operational test, a near-circular
  re-derivation trigger enumerated). `npm test`: 32/32. Moved here from "Latest Review" now that

- 2026-08-21 — `ADR-0002-ACCEPTANCE` (PR #12, merged `a20d647`): one independent read-only Codex
  reviewer verified the `ADR-0002` Status transition (Proposed → Accepted). Overall verdict
  **CLEAN AND READY** on all three checks: the transition was justified by verifiable evidence
  (`docs/reviews/ADR-0002-ADVERSARIAL-REVIEW.md` and `.../ADR-0002-ADVERSARIAL-REMEDIATION.md`
  exist, reach real conclusions, and their commits `548bb75`/`63429c9` are ancestors of `main`;
  `npm test` independently re-run at 32/32); no substantive semantic/model change slipped into the
  "acceptance housekeeping" patch (`git diff main --stat` showed only the ADR file and
  `.project/DECISIONS_LOG.md` changed); Future Work accurately separated completed gates from
  remaining work. One reviewer caveat (PR #10/#11 number mapping unconfirmable from local git
  alone) was independently resolved by Claude via `gh pr view`. Moved here from "Latest Review" now

- 2026-08-19/2026-08-20 — `NIGHT-RUNNER-FRESH-CLAUDE-EXECUTOR` (PR #8): three independent read-only
  Codex review passes plus one live supervised smoke test against the real `claude` CLI. Pass 1
  (on V1) verdict **REDESIGN** — a caller-supplied `cwd` did not actually sandbox the child
  process (parent-directory/symlink bypass, pre-spawn-only STOP check, inconsistent CLI flags);
  accepted and redesigned (executor-owned `mkdtemp` workspace, bidirectional `realpath`
  containment, discovered-flag capability restriction, STOP polling with whole-process-tree
  termination, expanded tests). A Windows CLI-resolution `ENOENT` bug (found by Claude directly,
  not a review pass) was fixed via `where`/`which` resolution, deliberately avoiding `shell:true`
  (Node `DEP0190` injection risk). Pass 2 verdict **APPROVE WITH REQUIRED CHANGES** — bypassable
  capability denylist and an unbounded resolver lookup, both fixed (denylist → positive allowlist;
  timeout added). Pass 3 verdict **APPROVED**, no required changes remaining. Live smoke test
  against the real CLI confirmed the allowed write succeeded and the forbidden write was denied
  and absent. Human approved PR #8 for merge ("PR #8 / NIGHT-RUNNER-FRESH-CLAUDE-EXECUTOR is
  APPROVED for merge"), recorded via a Gate Recording Commit; merge execution itself had not been
  performed as of this entry and required a separate, later explicit instruction. Moved here from
  "Latest Review" now that those sections describe `ADR-0002-ACCEPTANCE` instead, per this file's
  branch/task scoping. — branch `feat/night-runner-fresh-claude-executor`

- 2026-08-19/2026-08-20 — `NIGHT-RUNNER-FOUNDATION-FINAL` (correction pass on
  `chore/night-runner-foundation`, before PR #7 received human review): one independent read-only
  Codex reviewer, focused specifically on runtime-budget semantics and state consistency:
  hand-traced the corrected per-attempt runtime charging
  (`min(estimated_runtime_seconds, per_task_timeout_seconds)`, checked before every attempt
  including retries) against both new runtime-budget fixtures line-by-line, confirmed the
  `max_tasks` integer-validation fixture and code, confirmed `NIGHT_RUNNER.md` has no remaining
  stale "charge the full estimate once" description, and audited `.project/CURRENT_TASK.md` /
  `.project/REVIEW_STATE.md` for any remaining live/prospective PR-state language. Verdict
  **APPROVE WITH REQUIRED CHANGES** — no algorithmic, determinism, or documentation defect found;
  all required changes were state-metadata language quoted verbatim from `CURRENT_TASK.md`'s
  "Next Gate" and `REVIEW_STATE.md`'s then-current "Merge Decision" / "Pending Human Gate"
  sections (PR number, "opened", a `gh pr view 7` suggestion), plus one additional pre-existing
  History entry (the PR #4 entry's "remains a separate, later action not yet taken" clause) that
  the reviewer identified as the same category of live-state claim. Claude's final outcome:
  **APPROVED** (after rewriting all flagged sections to state only that a PR is
  expected/authorized and that human review/merge approval is a pending gate, with no PR number,
  status, or GitHub-query pointer recorded). All four required changes applied to
  `.project/CURRENT_TASK.md` and `.project/REVIEW_STATE.md`; `.project/DECISIONS_LOG.md` was not
  modified, per explicit instruction for this patch. Re-validated: `npm run test:night-runner`
  15/15, `npm test` 24/24, `npm run context` (reported this task active/current for that branch).
  Separately: `NIGHT-RUNNER-FOUNDATION` (PR #7) was human-approved for merge ("PR #7 /
  NIGHT-RUNNER-FOUNDATION is APPROVED for merge"), recorded via a Gate Recording Commit; merge
  execution itself had not been performed as of this entry and required a separate, later explicit
  instruction. Moved here from "Latest Review"/"Merge Decision"/"Pending Human Gate" now that those
  sections describe `NIGHT-RUNNER-FRESH-CLAUDE-EXECUTOR` instead, per this file's branch/task
  scoping. — branch `chore/night-runner-foundation`

- 2026-08-19 — `NIGHT-RUNNER-FOUNDATION` (first pass, PR #7): one independent read-only Codex
  reviewer, focused on requirement coverage against `docs/development/NIGHT_RUNNER.md`,
  determinism, the structural no-execution-capability invariant, algorithm correctness (budget
  consumption, limit-cascade, human-gated blocking, `main`-branch refusal, retry/timeout math),
  fixture coverage, and the Windows "run as script" guard fix. Verdict **APPROVE WITH REQUIRED
  CHANGES** — two documentation-consistency issues in `NIGHT_RUNNER.md` (a stale `--out` flag
  mention with no implementation; an inaccurate claim that a `STOPPED` dependency reaches the
  per-dependency `BLOCKED` check, when the queue-level STOPPED cascade always intercepts it
  first). No material algorithmic, determinism, or execution-capability defect found. Both fixes
  applied; two fixtures added (self-referencing dependency, `max_retries: 0` boundary) closing
  the two cheapest of several named test-coverage gaps. Final outcome **APPROVED**. Separately, a
  real Windows portability bug was found and fixed during Claude's own manual CLI smoke test (the
  "run as script" guard's naive `` file://${process.argv[1]} `` string comparison never matches a
  Windows path); the reviewer confirmed the fix (`pathToFileURL(process.argv[1]).href`). Moved
  here from "Latest Review" now that it describes the correction pass
  (`NIGHT-RUNNER-FOUNDATION-FINAL`) instead, per this file's branch/task scoping. — branch
  `chore/night-runner-foundation`

- 2026-08-19 — `PROJECT-CONTEXT-AUTO-BOOTSTRAP` (PR #6): reviewed by one independent read-only
  Codex reviewer, verdict **APPROVED** (no required changes). Human stated "PR #6 /
  PROJECT-CONTEXT-AUTO-BOOTSTRAP is APPROVED for merge", recorded via a Gate Recording Commit.
  PR #6 was squash-merged to `main` at `3f0b53b`, per explicit human confirmation. Moved here
  from "Latest Review"/"Merge Decision"/"Pending Human Gate" now that those sections describe the
  current task instead, per this file's branch/task scoping. — branch
  `chore/project-context-auto-bootstrap`

- 2026-08-19 — `PROJECT-CONTEXT-REVIEW-SCOPE` (PR #5): human approved for merge, stated directly
  as "PR #5 / PROJECT-CONTEXT-REVIEW-SCOPE is APPROVED for merge", recorded via a Gate Recording
  Commit. PR #5 was subsequently squash-merged to `main` at `fdc27d4` ("chore: scope review state
  to active task") — see `DECISIONS_LOG.md` for the durable record. — branch
  `chore/project-context-review-scope`

- 2026-08-19 — `PROJECT-CONTEXT-FREEZE-STATE` (PR #4): human approved for merge, stated directly
  as "PR #4 / PROJECT-CONTEXT-FREEZE-STATE is APPROVED for merge", recorded via a Gate Recording
  Commit; that commit recorded the approval only and did not itself authorize merge execution —
  see `DECISIONS_LOG.md` for the durable record. — branch `chore/project-context-freeze-state`

- 2026-08-19 — M0 Step 02B (Intent schema) — human decision: **APPROVED**, stated directly in
  conversation (not Claude-inferred). This entry is Claude's contemporaneous record of that
  conversation; it is not independently verifiable from git/GitHub state — the merge commit
  `0683e84` confirms the code landed, not that a human approved it. — merged to `main` at
  `0683e84`.
- 2026-08-19 — Project Context Bootstrap — human review of the branch/mechanism as a whole:
  **APPROVED WITH FINAL OPERATIONAL PATCH REQUIRED**, stated directly by the human, explicitly not
  final merge approval; authorized the `PROJECT-CONTEXT-MERGE-GATE` patch that was applied to
  satisfy it.
- 2026-08-19 — Project Context Bootstrap — human decision: **APPROVED for merge**, stated directly
  ("PROJECT-CONTEXT-BOOTSTRAP is APPROVED for merge"), recorded via a Gate Recording Commit, then
  executed on the human's explicit request for a PR + squash merge (base `main`, compare
  `chore/project-context-bootstrap`). — merged to `main` via PR #3, squash commit `c5d3dc8`.
