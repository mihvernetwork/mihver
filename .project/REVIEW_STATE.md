# Review State

Durable review/approval state, updated at the end of each task per `REVIEW_PROTOCOL.md`'s
completion checklist. Never invent or assume approval: if a human has not explicitly stated it,
record the gate as pending, not granted. A Codex or Claude `APPROVED` verdict is a technical
assessment, not human sign-off — see `AGENT_POLICY.md`'s Authority Hierarchy.

**Branch/task-scoped, like [CURRENT_TASK.md](./CURRENT_TASK.md).** The "Latest Review" section
below describes the current gate only when *both* hold: `CURRENT_TASK.md` is active for the
checked-out branch, and this file's own declared Branch/Task (below) matches that same
branch/task. `npm run context` checks this automatically. When either condition fails — no active
task, or this file's Branch/Task doesn't match the active one — the "Latest Review" content is
historical/stale task metadata only, not the current gate; `PROJECT_STATE.md`'s "Next Authorized
Action" is authoritative for what's next, not anything below.

## Latest Review

Task: M0-STEP-03A-REQUIREMENT-SPEC-SEMANTIC-CONTRACT
Branch: `m0/step-03a-requirement-contract`

Three independent read-only Codex reviewers (A: provenance/epistemic boundary; B: requirement
semantics — force mapping, conditions, leakage; C: lifecycle/handoff — eligibility,
Complete/Partial/Failed, versioning), each reviewing the first draft of `REQUIREMENT_SPEC.md`,
`ADR-0003-REQUIREMENT-DERIVATION-MODEL.md`, and `REQUIREMENT_CASES.md` (17 cases) against the
already-Accepted `INTENT_SPEC.md`/`ADR-0002` model. All three found real, independently-verified
defects; several were found by two or three reviewers independently, which strengthened confidence
in those specific findings. Claude verified every material finding directly against the actual text
before fixing (not relayed uncritically), then applied targeted fixes across all three documents.

Confirmed and fixed (verified by Claude against the cited text in each case):

- **Force-inflation bugs** (preference silently mapped to SHALL/MUST) in three cases — Case 10
  ("obligation-adjacent SHALL" invented, not part of the mapping table), Case 11 (positive-clause
  strength inflated by proximity to two prohibitions), Case 15 (SHALL asserted while negotiability
  was explicitly still an unresolved Unknown — an implicit resolution of that Unknown, forbidden by
  the contract's own text). Found independently by Reviewers A and B for 10/11/15.
- **Condition-strengthening bug**: both the main `REQUIREMENT_SPEC.md` text and Case 9 compiled
  "only if C" into "if and only if C," manufacturing an unstated converse. Found independently by
  Reviewers A and B.
- **Self-contradiction in the Complete/Partial/Failed model**: the Failed definition's own example
  was verbatim identical to the Complete-with-zero-Requirements example. Found by Reviewer C;
  redefined Failed around structural malformedness (a genuinely different kind of problem) instead.
- **Overclaim**: `REQUIREMENT_SPEC.md` asserted downstream stages "may partially consume" a Partial
  `RequirementSpec`, while `ADR-0003`'s own Open Questions explicitly left that undecided. Found by
  Reviewer C; softened to not authorize consumption mechanics this document doesn't own.
- **Interpretive-leap bug in Case 12**: the original scenario split a Claim into two Requirements
  based on what a phrase "plausibly covers" — itself an unauthorized interpretive judgment. Found
  independently by Reviewers A and B; replaced with a scenario whose split is mechanically entailed,
  not interpretive.
- **Invalid MEDIUM-Conflict scenario in Case 13**: the original data-isolation example was, under
  `INTENT_SPEC.md`'s own Decision Impact test, actually HIGH (a materially different architecture
  fork), making it an invalid input for this stage. Found independently by Reviewers A and C;
  replaced with a genuinely detail-level (report-delivery-day) Conflict.
- Smaller fixes: a dangling internal cross-reference to non-existent sections (caught by Claude, not
  a reviewer, while fixing the cardinality finding); a missing "Provenance expectations" section in
  Case 8; an ambiguous "marked invalid" phrasing in Case 14 that could imply mutating a historical
  artifact; an underspecified rationale/normative-content boundary for descriptive Claims; an
  unbounded Requirement-Level Inference concept, now given an explicit operational entailment test;
  a near-circular re-derivation trigger, now enumerated; a missing multi-Claim-partial-supersession
  rule in the main contract body (previously left entirely to an ADR Open Question).

Not actioned: Reviewer A's broader suggestion to add literal example IDs (`claim_id`s) throughout
all 17 cases — evaluated and judged a stylistic preference, not a confirmed defect, since
`INTENT_CASES.md` (this corpus's own established precedent) uses the same "the Claim" prose style
throughout without literal IDs.

## Required Changes

None remaining — every confirmed defect from all three reviewers was fixed and re-verified
(`npm test`: 32/32 throughout, unaffected since no schema/validator/fixture file was touched).

## Fixes Applied

See "Latest Review" above for the full list; applied directly to `docs/contracts/REQUIREMENT_SPEC.md`,
`docs/adr/ADR-0003-REQUIREMENT-DERIVATION-MODEL.md`, and `docs/examples/REQUIREMENT_CASES.md`.

## Pending Human Gate

PR to be opened per task instruction (push to the `devSerdar` fork, not `mihvernetwork` — per this
task's explicit instruction to use the fork for this task's development). Not to be merged by this
task. `ADR-0003`'s Status remains **Proposed**, per task instruction — human review of the PR is the
next gate.

## History

- 2026-08-21 — `ADR-0002-ACCEPTANCE` (PR #12, merged `a20d647`): one independent read-only Codex
  reviewer verified the `ADR-0002` Status transition (Proposed → Accepted). Overall verdict
  **CLEAN AND READY** on all three checks: the transition was justified by verifiable evidence
  (`docs/reviews/ADR-0002-ADVERSARIAL-REVIEW.md` and `.../ADR-0002-ADVERSARIAL-REMEDIATION.md`
  exist, reach real conclusions, and their commits `548bb75`/`63429c9` are ancestors of `main`;
  `npm test` independently re-run at 32/32); no substantive semantic/model change slipped into the
  "acceptance housekeeping" patch (`git diff main --stat` showed only the ADR file and
  `.project/DECISIONS_LOG.md` changed); Future Work accurately separated completed gates from
  remaining work. One reviewer caveat (PR #10/#11 number mapping unconfirmable from local git
  alone) was independently resolved by Claude via `gh pr view`. Moved here from "Latest Review" now
  that those sections describe `M0-STEP-03A-REQUIREMENT-SPEC-SEMANTIC-CONTRACT` instead, per this
  file's branch/task scoping. — branch `docs/adr-0002-acceptance`

- 2026-08-19/2026-08-20 — `NIGHT-RUNNER-FRESH-CLAUDE-EXECUTOR` (PR #8): three independent read-only
  Codex review passes plus one live supervised smoke test against the real `claude` CLI. Pass 1
  (on V1) verdict **REDESIGN** — a caller-supplied `cwd` did not actually sandbox the child
  process (parent-directory/symlink bypass, pre-spawn-only STOP check, inconsistent CLI flags);
  accepted and redesigned (executor-owned `mkdtemp` workspace, bidirectional `realpath`
  containment, discovered-flag capability restriction, STOP polling with whole-process-tree
  termination, expanded tests). A Windows CLI-resolution `ENOENT` bug (found by Claude directly,
  not a review pass) was fixed via `where`/`which` resolution, deliberately avoiding `shell:true`
  (Node `DEP0190` injection risk). Pass 2 verdict **APPROVE WITH REQUIRED CHANGES** — bypassable
  capability denylist and an unbounded resolver lookup, both fixed (denylist → positive allowlist;
  timeout added). Pass 3 verdict **APPROVED**, no required changes remaining. Live smoke test
  against the real CLI confirmed the allowed write succeeded and the forbidden write was denied
  and absent. Human approved PR #8 for merge ("PR #8 / NIGHT-RUNNER-FRESH-CLAUDE-EXECUTOR is
  APPROVED for merge"), recorded via a Gate Recording Commit; merge execution itself had not been
  performed as of this entry and required a separate, later explicit instruction. Moved here from
  "Latest Review" now that those sections describe `ADR-0002-ACCEPTANCE` instead, per this file's
  branch/task scoping. — branch `feat/night-runner-fresh-claude-executor`

- 2026-08-19/2026-08-20 — `NIGHT-RUNNER-FOUNDATION-FINAL` (correction pass on
  `chore/night-runner-foundation`, before PR #7 received human review): one independent read-only
  Codex reviewer, focused specifically on runtime-budget semantics and state consistency:
  hand-traced the corrected per-attempt runtime charging
  (`min(estimated_runtime_seconds, per_task_timeout_seconds)`, checked before every attempt
  including retries) against both new runtime-budget fixtures line-by-line, confirmed the
  `max_tasks` integer-validation fixture and code, confirmed `NIGHT_RUNNER.md` has no remaining
  stale "charge the full estimate once" description, and audited `.project/CURRENT_TASK.md` /
  `.project/REVIEW_STATE.md` for any remaining live/prospective PR-state language. Verdict
  **APPROVE WITH REQUIRED CHANGES** — no algorithmic, determinism, or documentation defect found;
  all required changes were state-metadata language quoted verbatim from `CURRENT_TASK.md`'s
  "Next Gate" and `REVIEW_STATE.md`'s then-current "Merge Decision" / "Pending Human Gate"
  sections (PR number, "opened", a `gh pr view 7` suggestion), plus one additional pre-existing
  History entry (the PR #4 entry's "remains a separate, later action not yet taken" clause) that
  the reviewer identified as the same category of live-state claim. Claude's final outcome:
  **APPROVED** (after rewriting all flagged sections to state only that a PR is
  expected/authorized and that human review/merge approval is a pending gate, with no PR number,
  status, or GitHub-query pointer recorded). All four required changes applied to
  `.project/CURRENT_TASK.md` and `.project/REVIEW_STATE.md`; `.project/DECISIONS_LOG.md` was not
  modified, per explicit instruction for this patch. Re-validated: `npm run test:night-runner`
  15/15, `npm test` 24/24, `npm run context` (reported this task active/current for that branch).
  Separately: `NIGHT-RUNNER-FOUNDATION` (PR #7) was human-approved for merge ("PR #7 /
  NIGHT-RUNNER-FOUNDATION is APPROVED for merge"), recorded via a Gate Recording Commit; merge
  execution itself had not been performed as of this entry and required a separate, later explicit
  instruction. Moved here from "Latest Review"/"Merge Decision"/"Pending Human Gate" now that those
  sections describe `NIGHT-RUNNER-FRESH-CLAUDE-EXECUTOR` instead, per this file's branch/task
  scoping. — branch `chore/night-runner-foundation`

- 2026-08-19 — `NIGHT-RUNNER-FOUNDATION` (first pass, PR #7): one independent read-only Codex
  reviewer, focused on requirement coverage against `docs/development/NIGHT_RUNNER.md`,
  determinism, the structural no-execution-capability invariant, algorithm correctness (budget
  consumption, limit-cascade, human-gated blocking, `main`-branch refusal, retry/timeout math),
  fixture coverage, and the Windows "run as script" guard fix. Verdict **APPROVE WITH REQUIRED
  CHANGES** — two documentation-consistency issues in `NIGHT_RUNNER.md` (a stale `--out` flag
  mention with no implementation; an inaccurate claim that a `STOPPED` dependency reaches the
  per-dependency `BLOCKED` check, when the queue-level STOPPED cascade always intercepts it
  first). No material algorithmic, determinism, or execution-capability defect found. Both fixes
  applied; two fixtures added (self-referencing dependency, `max_retries: 0` boundary) closing
  the two cheapest of several named test-coverage gaps. Final outcome **APPROVED**. Separately, a
  real Windows portability bug was found and fixed during Claude's own manual CLI smoke test (the
  "run as script" guard's naive `` file://${process.argv[1]} `` string comparison never matches a
  Windows path); the reviewer confirmed the fix (`pathToFileURL(process.argv[1]).href`). Moved
  here from "Latest Review" now that it describes the correction pass
  (`NIGHT-RUNNER-FOUNDATION-FINAL`) instead, per this file's branch/task scoping. — branch
  `chore/night-runner-foundation`

- 2026-08-19 — `PROJECT-CONTEXT-AUTO-BOOTSTRAP` (PR #6): reviewed by one independent read-only
  Codex reviewer, verdict **APPROVED** (no required changes). Human stated "PR #6 /
  PROJECT-CONTEXT-AUTO-BOOTSTRAP is APPROVED for merge", recorded via a Gate Recording Commit.
  PR #6 was squash-merged to `main` at `3f0b53b`, per explicit human confirmation. Moved here
  from "Latest Review"/"Merge Decision"/"Pending Human Gate" now that those sections describe the
  current task instead, per this file's branch/task scoping. — branch
  `chore/project-context-auto-bootstrap`

- 2026-08-19 — `PROJECT-CONTEXT-REVIEW-SCOPE` (PR #5): human approved for merge, stated directly
  as "PR #5 / PROJECT-CONTEXT-REVIEW-SCOPE is APPROVED for merge", recorded via a Gate Recording
  Commit. PR #5 was subsequently squash-merged to `main` at `fdc27d4` ("chore: scope review state
  to active task") — see `DECISIONS_LOG.md` for the durable record. — branch
  `chore/project-context-review-scope`

- 2026-08-19 — `PROJECT-CONTEXT-FREEZE-STATE` (PR #4): human approved for merge, stated directly
  as "PR #4 / PROJECT-CONTEXT-FREEZE-STATE is APPROVED for merge", recorded via a Gate Recording
  Commit; that commit recorded the approval only and did not itself authorize merge execution —
  see `DECISIONS_LOG.md` for the durable record. — branch `chore/project-context-freeze-state`

- 2026-08-19 — M0 Step 02B (Intent schema) — human decision: **APPROVED**, stated directly in
  conversation (not Claude-inferred). This entry is Claude's contemporaneous record of that
  conversation; it is not independently verifiable from git/GitHub state — the merge commit
  `0683e84` confirms the code landed, not that a human approved it. — merged to `main` at
  `0683e84`.
- 2026-08-19 — Project Context Bootstrap — human review of the branch/mechanism as a whole:
  **APPROVED WITH FINAL OPERATIONAL PATCH REQUIRED**, stated directly by the human, explicitly not
  final merge approval; authorized the `PROJECT-CONTEXT-MERGE-GATE` patch that was applied to
  satisfy it.
- 2026-08-19 — Project Context Bootstrap — human decision: **APPROVED for merge**, stated directly
  ("PROJECT-CONTEXT-BOOTSTRAP is APPROVED for merge"), recorded via a Gate Recording Commit, then
  executed on the human's explicit request for a PR + squash merge (base `main`, compare
  `chore/project-context-bootstrap`). — merged to `main` via PR #3, squash commit `c5d3dc8`.
